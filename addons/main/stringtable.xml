            <English>In regular ace medical, it is not possible to receive a fatal wound from limb damage. You may pass out or bleed out from the wounds, but you do not straight up die. With this AI and ONLY AI will get the limb damage factored in, making them less damage resistant so to speak. Only applicable if fata damage source is set to Either or Sum of Trauma!</English>
